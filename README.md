Facebook Replica (Practice Project)

This is a non-functional Facebook replica website created as a practice project to strengthen my front-end web development skills. The main focus of this project is replicating Facebook’s layout and design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features:
Replicated login and signup page design
Basic home page layout with header, sidebar, and feed structure
Styling with CSS for a Facebook-like interface
Simple JavaScript functionality (if added later)

Technologies Used:
1) HTML5 – for structure
2) CSS3 – for styling and layout
3) JavaScript (basic) – for interactive elements

Purpose of the Project:
This project is built purely for learning and practice. It is not connected to a backend and does not have real authentication or database functionality.
The goal was to:
Practice building real-world website layouts
Improve HTML and CSS structuring skills
Get comfortable with organizing files in a project
Lay the foundation for future dynamic web projects
